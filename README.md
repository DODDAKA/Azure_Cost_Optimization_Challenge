Azure Cosmos DB Cost Optimization for Billing Records
Overview
This solution implements a tiered storage architecture to optimize costs for managing billing records in an Azure serverless environment. It maintains frequently accessed "hot" data in Cosmos DB while archiving older records to cheaper Azure Blob Storage, reducing storage costs by approximately 73%.

Architecture
https://docs/architecture.png

The system consists of:

Hot Storage: Azure Cosmos DB for active records (last 3 months)

Cold Storage: Azure Blob Storage for archived records (older than 3 months)

Data Archival Service: Timer-triggered Azure Function that moves and compresses old records

Query Router: Transparently routes requests to appropriate storage while maintaining existing API contracts

Cost Optimization Analysis
Metric	Before Optimization	After Optimization	Reduction
Storage Size	600GB (2M records)	120GB (Cosmos) + 240GB (Blob)	-
Estimated Monthly Cost	$150+	~$40	73%
Implementation
Prerequisites
Azure subscription

Azure Cosmos DB account

Azure Storage account

Azure Functions tools

Setup Instructions
Create Blob Storage Container:

powershell
az storage container create --name archived-records --account-name YourStorageAccount
Deploy Archival Function:

powershell
az functionapp create `
  --resource-group YourResourceGroup `
  --name YourArchivalFunction `
  --storage-account YourStorageAccount `
  --runtime dotnet `
  --functions-version 4 `
  --consumption-plan-location eastus
Configure Application Settings:

Set CosmosDBConnection with your Cosmos DB connection string

Set BlobStorageConnection with your Blob Storage connection string

Data Migration
Run the archival function manually for initial migration:

powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-function.azurewebsites.net/admin/functions/ArchiveOldRecords" -Method Post
Verify data integrity by checking:

Record counts in Cosmos DB (should only contain recent records)

Blob storage container (should contain compressed archives)

Monitoring
Recommended monitoring metrics:

Archival Function:

Execution count

Success/failure rate

Records processed per run

Execution duration

Storage:

Cosmos DB storage size

Blob storage size

Request charges (RUs)
